        <strong>We are happy to admit Babes In Arms into a morning or afternoon performance</strong> with a U, PG or 12A certification.
        The Cinebabies performances are aimed at enabling parents with infants to come and watch movies with us in an environment more suitable for small children than our normal screenings- with the lights to half and the sound at a lower volume than normal, though there is no formal restriction on the age of children allowed to come to the performances. The screenings are primarily aimed at the parents rather than the children and we won't show any films rated higher than 12A.
        PLEASE NOTE: Cinebabies screenings are paused due to the current Cornovavirus pandemic.
